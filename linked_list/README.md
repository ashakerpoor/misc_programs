# linked_list

This program is designed to perform various functions related to linked lists, including creating nodes, sorting, inserting nodes, searching for specific nodes, and deleting lists. The program allows to create nodes with taking a long string as an input. The input is parsed into words where each word's stored as a node which holds up to the first 4 characters of the original word as well as the length of the original string. Once a node is created, it is linked to other nodes to form a linked list.

Next is the sorting function. The program sorts a current list in an alphabetically ascending order. This makes it easier to organize and access the data in the list.

Another function of the program is inserting nodes. This allows users to add new nodes to the linked list alphabetically.

Finally, the program offers a search function that enables users to find specific nodes in the linked list. The search function supports case sensitive and case insensitive modes.
